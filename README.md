# Rock-vs-Mine-prediction

When two army's had a war through there waterways attacking take place through submarines enemy army might have placed mines inside the water such that when they detect the new objects they explode.There might be rocks also below the water which won't explode. So,that the SONAR must be able to detect the mine (metal) and rock.
